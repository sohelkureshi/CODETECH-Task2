## Project Overview

### Project Title
Recipe App

### Project Summary
The Recipe App is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes functionalities for user authentication, recipe management, and a private component for authenticated users. Users can register, log in, reset their passwords, view recipes, add new recipes, and like recipes.

### Objectives
- Develop a full-stack web application using the MERN stack.
- Implement user authentication (registration, login, and password reset).
- Create protected routes accessible only to authenticated users.
- Provide functionalities for viewing, adding, and liking recipes.
- Ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

### Scope
- **Frontend**: Build the user interface using React and React Router.
- **Backend**: Develop the server-side using Node.js and Express.
- **Database**: Use MongoDB for storing user and recipe data.
- **Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication.
- **Protected Routes**: Ensure certain routes are accessible only to logged-in users.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for recipes.

### Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Set up project structure, initialize backend and frontend, and configure MongoDB.
- **Week 3**: Implement user authentication (registration, login, and password reset).
- **Week 4**: Develop recipe management features (viewing and adding recipes).
- **Week 5**: Implement liking functionality and protected routes.
- **Week 6**: Testing, bug fixing, and final project deployment.
